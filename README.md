# Laravel + ReactJS Code Challenge

This repository is an implementation created by me for this code challenge.

## Requeriments

```
Create a REST API using the Laravel PHP framework to model sports teams and their players.

Also create a U/I to show functionality. It would be best if U/I is in VueJS.

Be sure to include the following elements:

- migration for adding the teams table

- migration for adding the players table

- seed script to fill the tables with some data

- API endpoint to add a team

- API endpoint to add a player

- API endpoint to update a player

- API endpoint to get a team and its players

- Bonus: authentication method so only trusted entities may call the APIs

Schema for teams table (you may add additional fields as needed):

- id

- name

- created_at

- updated_at

Schema for players table (you may add additional fields as needed):

- id

- first_name

- last_name

- created_at

- updated_at
```
